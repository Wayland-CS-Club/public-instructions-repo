# CS-Club_2020-2021

## Instructions

To gain access this repository and fork it:

1. Send me an email (kevin_zhao@student.waylandps.org) with either your Github username or the email linked to your Github account.  
2. I will send you an invitation (so monitor your email), and after accepting you should be able to see the private repositories on the [club Github page](https://github.com/Wayland-CS-Club).  
3. Once you open the repository in a new tab/window, click the fork button near the upper right.  This will create a copy of the repository.  
4. (Optional) Your fork will be a private repository, but other club members will have access by default.  If you don't want them to judge your code, you can go into `Settings` -> `Manage Access` and remove the `All_Members` group.  However, due to the way Github works we (Andrew, Eric, and I) will still be able to see your repository.
