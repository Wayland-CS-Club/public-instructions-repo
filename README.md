# CS-Club_2020-2021

## Instructions

To gain access to the other club repositories:

1. Send me an email (kevin_zhao@student.waylandps.org) with either your Github username or the email linked to your Github account.  
2. I will send you an invitation via email and after accepting you should be able to see the private repositories on the [club Github page](https://github.com/Wayland-CS-Club).  

## Useful Git Stuff

A Github fork is a way to make your own personal copy of a repository, while also being able to pull new updates from parent repository.  
Forking a repository is pretty straightforward: 
1. On the Github page of the parent repository, click the fork button near the upper right. 
2. (Optional) Your fork will be a private repository, but other club members will have access by default.  If you don't want them to judge your code, you can go into `Settings` -> `Manage Access` and remove the `All_Members` group.  However, due to the way Github works, we (Andrew, Eric, and I) will still be able to see your repository.
